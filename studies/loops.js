/**
 * A loop:
 * is a programming structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
 *  
 * JavaScript supports four types of loops:
 * For loop.: A for loop executes a block of code a specified number of times.
 * While loop.: A while loop executes a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
 * Do...while loop.: A do...while loop executes a block of code at least once, and then checks the condition. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute.
 * For...of loop.: A for...of loop loops through the values of an iterable object.
 * 
 * Here is an example of a for loop:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
This loop will print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.
Here is an example of a while loop:
let i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
This loop will also print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.
Here is an example of a do...while loop:
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);
This loop will also print the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.
Here is an example of a for...of loop:
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];

for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
