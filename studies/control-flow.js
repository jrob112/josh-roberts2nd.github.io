/**
 * Control flow:
 * is the order in which statements are executed in a program. 
 * The default control flow is for statements to be read and executed in order from left-to-right, top-to-bottom in a program file.
 * 
 * Control structures:
 * are used to alter the control flow of a program. 
 * They allow programmers to make decisions about which code is executed as the program runs.
 * 
 * Conditional statements:
 * allow a program to make decisions based on different conditions. 
 * The most common conditional statements are if, else if, and else.
 * 
 * Loops:
 * allow a program to execute a block of code repeatedly. 
 * The most common loops are for, while, and do..while.
 * 
 * Functions:
 * allow a program to group together a block of code into a single unit. 
 * unctions can be called repeatedly, with different arguments each time.
 * 
 * Error handling:
 * allows a program to deal with unexpected errors. 
 * The most common error handling statements are try and catch.
 * By understanding how control flow works, programmers can write more efficient and effective code.
 * 
 *Here are some examples of control flow in JavaScript:
// Conditional statement
if (condition) {// Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {// Code to be executed if condition is false
}
// Loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {// Code to be executed repeatedly
}
// Function
function myFunction(arg) {// Code to be executed}
