// Simple Data Types- a single immutable value used to store data in a variable
// immuttable = unchangeable
// !!can be replaced but not changed!!
/*
*1:numbers = hold a nemeric value as intergers, floating points(decimals), or exponents
*2:strings = a group of characters encased in '', " ", or ``
*3:booleans = are logical comparison data type that is either true or false as value
*4:null = an empty value or absence of value
*5:undefined = the default value in which a variable has not been defined

//examples
// 1; var num = 10456e8;
// 2; var nameFirst = 'Josh';
// 3; var hasHorses = true;
// 4; var a = null;
// 5; var x;

// console.log(num);

Complex data types in JavaScript are those that can store multiple values. 
They are in contrast to primitive data types, which can only store a single value. 
The most common complex data types in JavaScript are arrays and objects.

Arrays
Arrays are objects that contain a collection of values. 
The values in an array can be of any type, including other arrays, objects, or primitive values. 
Arrays are created using square brackets ([]).

Objects
Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
The keys in an object can be of any type, including other arrays, objects, or primitive values. 
The values in an object can be of any type, including other arrays, objects, or primitive values. 
Objects are created using curly braces ({}).

//examples
let array = [1,2,3,4,5]
let object - {a:1, b:2, c:3}
